# Indian Sign Language (ISL) Gesture Recognition & English Translation System

An AI-powered system that recognizes Indian Sign Language gestures (A–Z and 0–9) in real time using computer vision and machine learning, with the goal of translating signs into English text.

`Python` · `MediaPipe` · `scikit-learn`

## Overview

This project is part of a larger goal to build a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) to English translation system. The current module focuses on static gestures for:

- **Alphabets:** A–Z
- **Digits:** 0–9

The system uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and a Random Forest classifier for gesture recognition. It supports both single-hand and two-hand gestures, correctly distinguishing between left and right hands.

## Features

- ✅ Real-time gesture recognition via webcam
- ✅ MediaPipe-based hand landmark extraction (21 landmarks per hand, 3D)
- ✅ Left-hand and right-hand detection with proper ordering
- ✅ Data augmentation for improved model generalization
- ✅ Cross-validation for reliable evaluation
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- ✅ Confidence scores for predictions
- ✅ Prediction smoothing for stable output
- ✅ Supports up to 2 hands simultaneously

## How It Works

### Pipeline

```
Dataset Images (A–Z, 0–9)
        ↓
extract_landmarks.py       → Detect hands via MediaPipe, extract 21 landmarks/hand
        ↓
landmarks_preprocess.py    → Clean, encode, augment, split (train/test)
        ↓
train_model.py             → Cross-validate, tune, train Random Forest
        ↓
realtime_prediction.py     → Real-time webcam prediction
```

### Landmark Representation

Each image is converted into a 128-dimensional feature vector:

| Hand | Feature Type | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Left | type (0) + 21 landmarks × 3 (x,y,z) | 64 |
| Right | type (1) + 21 landmarks × 3 (x,y,z) | 64 |
| **Total** | | **128** |

- Coordinates are normalized relative to the wrist (landmark 0) for translation invariance.
- If a hand is not detected, its slots are filled with zeros (with type preserved so the model knows which hand is missing).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhevanaVasani28/isl-gesture-recognition.git
cd isl-gesture-recognition
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare Dataset

Place your gesture image folders inside:

```
datasets/static_gestures/
├── A/
├── B/
├── ...
├── Z/
├── 0/
├── 1/
├── ...
└── 9/
```

### 5. Run the Pipeline (in order)

```bash
# Step 1: Extract landmarks from images
python src/extract_landmarks.py

# Step 2: Preprocess, augment, and split data
python src/landmarks_preprocess.py

# Step 3: Train the Random Forest model
python src/train_model.py

# Step 4: (Optional) Analyze the trained model
python src/analyze_model.py

# Step 5: Run real-time prediction
python src/realtime_prediction.py
```

**Controls during real-time prediction:**
- `Q` → Quit
- `R` → Reset prediction smoothing

## Model Details

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | RandomForestClassifier |
| Trees | Tuned via RandomizedSearchCV |
| Cross-Validation | Stratified 3-fold |
| Data Augmentation | Rotation, scaling, translation, noise |
| Confidence Threshold | 0.6 (configurable) |
| Classes | 36 (A–Z + 0–9) |

## Results

After training, the following files are generated inside `results/`:

- `rf_classification_report.txt` — Precision, recall, F1-score per class
- `rf_confusion_matrix.png` — Visual confusion matrix
